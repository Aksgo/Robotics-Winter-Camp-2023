# Task:
Go to the Task_scripts folder to find the task files.
## Task 1 
Your task is to use env.move() and p.getKeyboardEvents() to control the husky using the arrow keys
of you keyboard and make the husky stop when the spacebar is pressed just like games :D

Submission Link for task 1 [here](https://forms.gle/2XL9aa3xo4yo5s1T9)
